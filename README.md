## Project
The goal of this project was to answer the question - "What are the effects of space travel on DNA?"
This project involves retrieving specific data from 3 datasets using web scraping practices (BeautifulSoup and Selenium), parsing the associated JSON files to compile the data in an appropriate form
creating normal distributions and comparing them using Cohen's D., and then creating a front-end-based website to showcase our work flow.
