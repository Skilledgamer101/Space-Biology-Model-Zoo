## Project
The goal of this project was to answer the question - "What are the effects of space travel on DNA?"
This project involves retrieving specific data from 3 datasets using web scraping practices (BeautifulSoup and Selenium), parsing the associated JSON files to compile the data in an appropriate form,
creating normal distributions and comparing them using Cohen's D., and then creating a front-end-based website to showcase our work flow.

## Install Dependencies
### Web Scraping
pip install Selenium BeautifulSoup4
### Interpreting Arrays
pip install numpy
### Normal Distribution Plots
pip install matplotlib
